### Plant Disease Prediction Using CNN ðŸŒ±

This project aims to predict diseases in plants by analyzing images of their leaves using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. Early identification of plant diseases is crucial for maintaining crop health, reducing losses, and increasing yield. This project provides a scalable AI-based solution to classify different plant diseases or determine if the plant is healthy.

### **Overview of the Project**

- **Goal**: Accurately classify plant diseases based on leaf images.
- **Model**: A custom-built CNN trained on a dataset of labeled leaf images.
- **Input**: Images of plant leaves (RGB format).
- **Output**: Predicted disease name or confirmation of a healthy plant.

### **How It Works**

1. **Dataset Preparation**: 
   - The dataset includes thousands of plant leaf images with labels for diseases or a healthy state.
   - Images are preprocessed (resized, normalized) to ensure compatibility with the model.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Convolutional layers extract key features from the images.
   - Pooling layers reduce spatial dimensions to make computations efficient.
   - Fully connected (dense) layers classify the image into predefined categories.

3. **Training Process**:
   - The model is trained using labeled data with techniques like **data augmentation** to improve generalization.
   - Key metrics like accuracy and loss are monitored for both training and validation.

4. **Prediction**:
   - A new leaf image is preprocessed and passed through the trained model.
   - The model predicts the most likely class (disease type or healthy).

### **Applications**

- **Agriculture**: Helps farmers detect diseases early, improving crop health and reducing losses.
- **Gardening**: Assists gardeners in identifying issues with ornamental plants.
- **Research**: Provides a foundation for further work in agricultural AI.
